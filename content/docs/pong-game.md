#### Role

As a **UX/UI Designer** and **Web Developer** of this product, I have recreated the look and feel of arcade games to build my own version of the PONG game. Relying on online documentation, I used vanilla **JavaScript** and **P5.js** to code the functionalities of the game and CSS to implement the UI.

#### Brief

I wanted to create a two players experience where the users could enter their games to record the score before starting the match. All the instructions on how to play are shown on the screen and the winner of the match is congratulated at the end. This was a project part of a Full-Stack Web-Development bootcamp.
