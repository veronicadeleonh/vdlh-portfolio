### About Mondly

Mondly is a language laring app which mission is to build bridges between people and cultures by making language learning fun and easy through technological innovation.

On 2022 Mondly got acquired by Pearson, giving the Product and Marketing team a chance for a big redesign of Mondly's platform and web presence.

### My Role at Mondly

Making AB Test about the performance of the Old Design vs. the New one was crucial to understand the future marketing and design steps of the company. Before I joined the team, the product designers put in place a detailed Design System that served as base of all assets we developed for the tests.

Inside our Product Team, I collaborated closely with one of my colleagues on the creation of a Styleguide in Notion, were we documentes all the important aspedts of the New Mondly brand that we were building up.
