#### About BaseCase

BaseCase is a no-code platform that allows the users to translate spreadsheets into interactive & data-driven content. With BaseCase the user is able to integrate UI elements and realize dynamic calculations on the screen.

#### My role at Basecase

My collaboration began with assisting in the creation of digital and physical brochures, along with the necessary images for the web and recurring social media campaigns. After expressing interest in building my own BaseCase apps, I became involved in redesigning BaseCase's old demo applications and conceptualizing new ones upon request.

#### The Demo App Library

As **UX/UI Designer**, I contributed to this project by designing and implementing a series of demos that formed the BaseCase Demo Apps Library. This library is a collection of interactive presentations showcasing the capabilities of the BaseCase platform as a data visualization tool.

#### Marketing Assets

With the need of suppporting Basecase's online presence, we developed a serie of images for marketing campaings that could go from the launching of new features until the participation of the company on fairs. I was also reponsible for the development of images used on Basecase website, some of them are still live under each category on https://basecase.com/features
