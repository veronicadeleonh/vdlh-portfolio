#### About BaseCase

BaseCase is a no-code platform that allows the users to translate spreadsheets into interactive & data-driven content, tailored for the healthcare and medical science business.

#### My role at Basecase

My collaboration began with assisting the Marketing team on the design of digital and physical brochures, along with the necessary images for the web and recurring social media campaigns. After expressing interest in building my own BaseCase apps, I became involved in the production of client-facing tools and responsible for the BaseCase Apps Library.

#### The Demo App Library

This library was a collection of tools that supported BaseCase documentation, illustrating everything from basic functionalities to complex features, along with product updates and use case tutorials. I was fully responsible for the ideation, design (or redesign), and implementation of these tools.

#### Marketing Assets

To support BaseCase's online presence, we developed a series of images for marketing campaigns, ranging from new feature launches to company participation in fairs. I was also responsible for creating images for the BaseCase website, many of which are still live under each category on <a href="https://basecase.com/features" target="_blank">BaseCase Features<span class="fi" style="background-image: url(images/ext-link.svg)"></span></a> page.
