#### About BaseCase

BaseCase is a drag-and-drop platform to create interactive online content. With BaseCase the user is able to integrate UI elements and realize dynamic calculations on the screen.

#### My role at Basecase

As **UX/UI Designer** I contributed to this project being responsible for the design and implementation of a line of demos that built the BaseCase Demo Apps Library.
This library was a collection of demos are interactive presentations that showcase the capabilities of the BaseCase platform as a data visualization tool.

#### The Demo App Library

Each one of these applications were built based upon requests and needs from the Customer Success (CS) Team. For each app, the CS Team would provide a list of functionalities and rough ideas about the UX of the tool.
After brief team discussions and brainstorming, I would make the final decisions to translate our ideas into user-friendly intereactive tools that follow the **UX/UI principles**.

<!-- #### Interesting Insights

The story-telling of some applications required the implementation of a navigation that allowed users to jump between different sections of the app. An initial calculation page could also dynamically update the linked content throughout the following sections of the tool.
BaseCase interactive apps were mainly designed for iPad users. Nevertheless, I had the chance to work on a phone screen adaptation when BaseCase launched an Add-On supported by iPhone as well.
