#### About BaseCase

BaseCase is a drag-and-drop platform to create interactive online content. With BaseCase the user is able to integrate UI elements and realize dynamic calculations on the screen.

#### My role at Basecase

My collaboration began with assisting in the creation of digital and physical brochures, along with the necessary images for the web and recurring social media campaigns. After expressing interest in building my own BaseCase apps, I became involved in redesigning BaseCase's old demo applications and conceptualizing new ones upon request.

#### The Demo App Library

As **UX/UI Designer**, I contributed to this project by designing and implementing a series of demos that formed the BaseCase Demo Apps Library. This library is a collection of interactive presentations showcasing the capabilities of the BaseCase platform as a data visualization tool.
