#### About EyeEm

**EyeEm** is as a global photography community and marketplace that facilitates connections between creators and prominent brands to source original and on-brand content. The platform's mission centers around empowering its community by providing them with a robust platform for discovery, while simultaneously granting brands access to powerful creative imagery from around the globe.

#### My role at EyeEm

During my role at EyeEm, I collaborated with the Product team on platform maintenance, conducting research, prototyping, and testing solutions to deliver the best possible version for implementation.

#### EyEem's Cart & Checkout Flow

In 2022, EyeEm re-vamped the Cart and Checkout Process project with the scope of increasing the revenuw and offering the users a fresh purchase experience. We started making a descriptive analisis of the current flow, first as a documentation and then by identifiying the pain points in Figma.

We discovered that we could divide our findings into two groups: the quick wins, referring to the short-term fixes that could create an inmediate impact, and the long-term wins, which requiered extra time and resources from the dev team.

Note: The payment process was not built in Webflow, which required the involvement of the Front-End team.

#### EyeEm's Web presence

<a href="http://eyeem.com" target="_blank">EyeEm.com</a> combines the flexibility of Webflow with the capabilities of front-end development, giving designers complete control over the UI and behavior of some areas of the website. During my time at EyeEm, I was responsible for maintaining the site.

In addition to the main webpage, EyeEm frequently launched landing pages to support ongoing marketing campaigns. Collaborating closely with the Marketing and Innovation teams, I was involved in the ideation, design, and conceptualization of these sites. I then took full responsibility for the implementation and final release of these web projects using Webflow, sharing account control with the Front-End Team.
