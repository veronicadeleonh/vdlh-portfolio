#### About EyeEm

**EyeEm** is as a photography community and marketplace that facilitates connections between creators and prominent brands to source original and on-brand content.

#### My role at EyeEm

During my role at EyeEm I was one of Designers inside the Product team, specifically collaborating on the maintenance of the browser-based application. 

#### The Product Team

Our Product Design team worked closely with project managers, data analysts and developers. With regular meetings and sync-ups, we united forces to work on the continuous development of the platform. We would start by gathering the relevant numbers to ensure we would be working on **data-driven** solutions.

On 2022, EyeEm decided to review the Cart & Process after noticing that considerably high numbers of users were abandonning the flow before compliting the purchase.

I reviewed the data report made by the team on the previous months, and created a descriptive analysis mapping the pain points of the flow based on it.

 I listed all posible **Quick wins**, noticing the drops on the flow could be related to inconsistencies in the background color along the flow, TAX calculation being done too soon during the process and wrong implementation of the SSO with Google and Facebook for logged out users. 

I involved more stakeholders from the Legal Team to make sure we could go full-in with major changes during Checkout, like pre-saving the billing information and the payment details.

#### Low-fi & Prototype

I then moved to Figma to create the **prototypes** to share with the PM and the Data and Front-End team. We shared insights and discussed the solutions during feedback sessions. After a couple of iterations, we came up with a solution that ticked all boxes from our Quick wins list.

#### Hi-fi & Redesigned screens

The final step at EyeEm would be to prepare the High-Fidelity file for the developers, making use of EyeEm's **Design system**.

#### EyeEm's Web presence

<a href="http://eyeem.com" target="_blank">EyeEm.com <span class="fi" style="background-image: url(images/ext-link.svg)"></span></a> combines the flexibility of **Webflow** with the capabilities of front-end development, giving designers complete control over the UI and behavior of some areas of the website. During my time at EyeEm, I was responsible for maintaining these areas of the site.

In addition to the main webpage, EyeEm frequently launched landing pages to support ongoing marketing campaigns. Collaborating closely with the Marketing and Innovation teams, I was involved in the ideation and design of these sites. I then took full responsibility for the implementation and final release of these web projects using Webflow.

Here are some live examples:
