<h3 id="about-mondly">About Mondly</h3>
<p>Mondly is a language learning app that aims to make language learning fun and easy through technological innovation and multiple lanaguage combinations.</p>
<p>On 2022 Mondly got acquired by Pearson, giving the Product team a chance for a big redesign of Mondly&rsquo;s platform and web presence.</p>
<h3 id="my-role-at-mondly">My Role at Mondly</h3>
<p>During my stay at Mondly, making A/B Tests about the performance of the Old vs. the New Design was important to validate with data the development of the rebrand and plan the marketing strategies for this design transition.</p>
<p>Before I joined the team, the product designers put in place a detailed Design System that served as base for all the future assets we developed on the way. I collaborated closely with one of my colleagues on the creation of a Styleguide in Notion, were we documented the details of the New Mondly Brand and its usage.</p>

<p class="photo-footnote">View of some of the components built for the Styleguide components in Figma</p>
<h3 id="mondly-web--marketing">Mondly Web &amp; Marketing</h3>
<p>Some of the tests we made included the redesign of the Offer page and the App and Google Store images, both resulting on a increase of average time on page and the unique pageviews on the Offer page and an increase of almost 3% of App Store downloads with Mondly&rsquo;s dark theme version, meeting our team OKR&rsquo;s for Q1 in 2024.</p>

<div class="box-notes orange">
  Light mode was introduced based on a benchmark research that showed competitors choosing light backgrounds on their app store images. We organized several Design Team workshops to develop a light version of our new brand, that we could include on the A/B Testing.

<h3 id="mondly-growth">Mondly Growth</h3>
<p>The Growth team initiated several A/B tests aimed at increasing Premium Subscriptions. We tested various strategies, including designing new banners, creating templates for seasonal campaigns, and making UX improvements to the Free Trial screen.</p>

<p class="photo-footnote">New layout for the in-App adds created for the Spring Campaign. Both version where subject of an A/B test on the background images. Both images were generated using Midjourney</p>
<h3 id="marketing-campaigns">Marketing Campaigns</h3>
<p>One major ongoing marketing campaign involved creating an onboarding flow with a questionnaire that guided users to a payment screen. I was responsible for the design and UX of this flow. The biggest challenge was developing a style that seamlessly blended elements of both the old and new Mondly branding.</p>

<h4 id="about-eyeem">About EyeEm</h4>

<h4 id="the-platform">The Platform</h4>
<p>EyeEm is a browser-based platform for photographers to get discovered and for brands to access a curated selection of images, dividing the user base into two main groups: the creators and the buyers.</p>
<h4 id="eyeems-cart--checkout-flow">EyEem&rsquo;s Cart &amp; Checkout Flow</h4>
<p>Our Product Design team worked closely with project managers, data analysts, developers. In the case of the Cart &amp; Checkout re-vamp, I reviewed the data research and report made by the team on the previous months, to then create a descriptive analysis and map the pain points of the flow.</p>

<p class="photo-footnote">Identifying Data take-awys and pain points on the flow</p>
<p>These were the take-aways we got from identifying all pain points in the flow:</p>

      <li>Inconsistency in bg color</li>

<p>We iterate different possible solutions in Figma, coming out with a solution that ticked all the Quick fixes boxes and at the same time took in consideration the constraints from the legal team and the capacity of the developers.</p>

<p><a href="http://eyeem.com" target="_blank">EyeEm.com <span class="fi" style="background-image: url(images/ext-link.svg)"></span></a> combines the flexibility of Webflow with the capabilities of front-end development, giving designers complete control over the UI and behavior of some areas of the website. During my time at EyeEm, I was responsible for maintaining these areas of the site.</p>
<p>In addition to the main webpage, EyeEm frequently launched landing pages to support ongoing marketing campaigns. Collaborating closely with the Marketing and Innovation teams, I was involved in the ideation and design of these sites. I then took full responsibility for the implementation and final release of these web projects using Webflow, sharing account control with the Front-End team.</p>

<p>My collaboration began with assisting the Marketing team on the design of digital and physical brochures, along with the necessary images for the web and recurring social media campaigns.

<p>To support BaseCase&rsquo;s online presence, we developed a series of images for marketing campaigns, ranging from new feature launches to company participation in fairs.
