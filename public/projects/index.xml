<h3 id="about-mondly">About Mondly</h3>
<p><strong>Mondly</strong> is a language learning app that aims to make language learning fun and easy through technological innovation and multiple lanaguage combinations.</p>
<p>On 2022 Mondly got acquired by Pearson, giving the Product team a chance for a big redesign of Mondly&rsquo;s platform and web presence.</p>
<h3 id="my-role-at-mondly">My Role at Mondly</h3>
<p>During my stay at Mondly, making <strong>A/B Tests</strong> about the performance of the Old vs. the New Design was important to validate with data the development of the rebrand and plan the marketing strategies for this design transition.</p>
<p>Before I joined the team, the product designers put in place a detailed <strong>Design System</strong> that served as base for all the future assets we developed on the way. I collaborated closely with one of my colleagues on the creation of a <strong>Styleguide</strong> in Notion, were we documented the details of the New Mondly Brand and its usage.</p>

<p class="photo-footnote">View of some of the components built for the Styleguide in Figma</p>
<h3 id="mondly-web--marketing">Mondly Web &amp; Marketing</h3>
<p>Some of the tests we made included the redesign of the Offer page and the App and Google Store images, resulting on a increase of average time on page and the unique pageviews on the Offer page, and an increase of almost 3% of App Store downloads with Mondly&rsquo;s dark theme version, meeting our team OKR&rsquo;s for Q1 in 2024.</p>

<div class="box-notes orange">
  Light mode was introduced after a benchmark research that showed competitors choosing light backgrounds on their app store images. We organized several <strong>Design Team workshops</strong> to develop a light version of our new brand, that we could include on the A/B Testing.

<h3 id="mondly-growth">Mondly Growth</h3>
<p>The Growth team initiated several <strong>A/B tests</strong> aimed at increasing Premium Subscriptions. We tested various strategies, including designing new banners, creating templates for seasonal campaigns, and making UX improvements to the Free Trial screen.</p>

<p class="photo-footnote">New layout for the in-App adds created for the Spring Campaign. Both version where subject of an A/B test on the background images. Both images were generated using Midjourney</p>
<h3 id="marketing-campaigns">Marketing Campaigns</h3>
<p>One major ongoing marketing campaign involved creating an onboarding flow with a questionnaire that guided users to a payment screen. I was responsible for the design and UX of this flow. The biggest challenge was developing a style that seamlessly blended elements of both the old and new Mondly branding.</p>

<h4 id="about-eyeem">About EyeEm</h4>
<p><strong>EyeEm</strong> is as a photography community and marketplace that facilitates connections between creators and prominent brands to source original and on-brand content.</p>
<h4 id="my-role-at-eyeem">My role at EyeEm</h4>
<p>During my role at EyeEm I was one of Designers inside the Product team, specifically collaborating on the maintenance of the browser-based application.</p>
<h4 id="the-product-team">The Product Team</h4>
<p>Our Product Design team worked closely with project managers, data analysts and developers. With regular meetings and sync-ups, we united forces to work on the continuous development of the platform. We would start by gathering the relevant numbers to ensure we would be working on <strong>data-driven</strong> solutions.</p>
<p>On 2022, EyeEm decided to review the Cart &amp; Process after noticing that considerably high numbers of users were abandonning the flow before compliting the purchase.</p>
<p>I reviewed the data report made by the team on the previous months, and created a descriptive analysis mapping the pain points of the flow based on it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/eyeem/images/eyeem-user-flow.png" type="" alt="EyeEm Hi-fi"  /></p>
<p class="photo-footnote">Identifying Data take-aways and UI pain points on the Cart & Checkout flow</p>
<p>I listed all posible <strong>Quick wins</strong>, noticing the drops on the flow could be related to inconsistencies in the background color along the flow, TAX calculation being done too soon during the process and wrong implementation of the SSO with Google and Facebook for logged out users.</p>
<p>I involved more stakeholders from the Legal Team to make sure we could go full-in with major changes during Checkout, like pre-saving the billing information and the payment details.</p>
<h4 id="low-fi--prototype">Low-fi &amp; Prototype</h4>
<p>I then moved to Figma to create the <strong>prototypes</strong> to share with the PM and the Data and Front-End team. We shared insights and discussed the solutions during feedback sessions. After a couple of iterations, we came up with a solution that ticked all boxes from our Quick wins list.</p>

<p>The final step at EyeEm would be to prepare the High-Fidelity file for the developers, making use of EyeEm&rsquo;s <strong>Design system</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="eyeems-web-presence">EyeEm&rsquo;s Web presence</h4>
<p><a href="http://eyeem.com" target="_blank">EyeEm.com <span class="fi" style="background-image: url(images/ext-link.svg)"></span></a> combines the flexibility of <strong>Webflow</strong> with the capabilities of front-end development, giving designers complete control over the UI and behavior of some areas of the website. During my time at EyeEm, I was responsible for maintaining these areas of the site.</p>
<p>In addition to the main webpage, EyeEm frequently launched landing pages to support ongoing marketing campaigns. Collaborating closely with the Marketing and Innovation teams, I was involved in the ideation and design of these sites. I then took full responsibility for the implementation and final release of these web projects using Webflow.</p>

<p>My collaboration began with assisting the Marketing team on the design of digital and physical brochures, along with the necessary images for the web and recurring social media campaigns.

<p>To support BaseCase&rsquo;s online presence, we developed a series of images for marketing campaigns, ranging from new feature launches to company participation in fairs.
