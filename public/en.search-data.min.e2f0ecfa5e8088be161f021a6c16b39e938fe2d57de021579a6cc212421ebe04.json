With BaseCase the user is able to integrate UI elements and realize dynamic calculations on the screen. Role # As UX/UI Designer I contributed to this project being responsible for the design and implementation of a line of demos that built the BaseCase Demo Apps Library. This library was a collection of demos are interactive presentations that showcase the capabilities of the BaseCase platform as a data visualization tool. Brief # Each one of these applications were built based upon requests and needs from the Customer Success (CS) Team. For each app, the CS Team would provide a list of functionalities and rough ideas about the UX of the tool. After brief team discussions and brainstorming, I would make the final decisions to translate our ideas into user-friendly intereactive tools that follow the UX/UI principles.\n1 Powerpoint Slides # explaining app requirements 2 Brainstorming UX # wireframing and sketching on paper 3 UI design choices # experiment with product’s corporate identity for a balanced UI 4 UX/UI implementation # using BaseCase to obtain the final product Interesting Insights # The story-telling of some applications required the implementation of a navigation that allowed users to jump between different sections of the app. An initial calculation page could also dynamically update the linked content throughout the following sections of the tool. BaseCase interactive apps were mainly designed for iPad users. Nevertheless, I had the chance to work on a phone screen adaptation when BaseCase launched an Add-On supported by iPhone as well.\nDrug Dosage Calculator Tool # "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/bella-vista-video/","title":"Bella Vista Video","section":"Docs","content":" Bella Vista Video # 2016, Berlin\nBella Vista is the name of a humble fisherman area in the southeast coast of Isla Margarita. In this area of the island I lived and grew up with my parents and my two siblings. Living on a 7th floor apartment in a building located almost at the middle of Bella Vista Beach, gave us an ample view of the Guaraguao’s Bay. Here we were able to see the sea everyday just by looking through any of the windows pointing south or by walking through the terraces.\nLast summer I spent almost 3 months there, at home. Since the first day I arrived, contemplating the view was a daily activity. Every day I was blown away by the rich color tones and the happy-local-fisherman vibe that I was able to relax my mind and let go of my thoughts.\nBeautiful view is the translation for Bella Vista.\nIn Bella Vista every day begins with the rise of the sun as the fisherman (pescadores) prepare and start their boats (peñeros) for the early morning round. As the sky turns blue, the beach would also get filled by locals who enjoy the beach, the sun, and the palms. This, however, won’t stop the pescadores to carry on with their fishing activities, or the peñeros from coming and going until the sun goes down again.\nThis video is to my family, my mom, dad, brother and sister; my favorite people. They are the only ones with whom I could share exactly what I feel when I see these scenes, because the five of us will always have an indestructible connection.\nMusic # LA LÁGRIMA\nTraditional\nArrangements María Márquez\nSpecial thanks to # Tulio De León\nNatalia De León\nLuigia Fortino de De León\nNicholas M.
