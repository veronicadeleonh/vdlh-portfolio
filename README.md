# Product Design UXUI Portfolio

I'm Verónica, an analog photography enthusiast and female solo traveler based in Berlin. Since my first solo trip to Cuba in 2018, I’ve been drawn to bringing at least one analog camera with me in all my journeys.

Using analog cameras helps me disconnect from the digital world, creating space for deeper connections with the places I visit and the people I meet.

I plan to continue exploring and visiting more amazing islands and coasts!

When I'm not traveling, I design and build interfaces. I recently created a website to showcase my work as a Product Designer, highlighting key projects and milestones.
